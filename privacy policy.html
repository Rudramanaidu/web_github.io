    <font size="4px"><p>As detailed in our Cookie Policy, Tap Academy and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated 
        data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons 
        (together, “Data Collection Tools”) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track 
        and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie 
        data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.

         in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into
          the Services, and recognizing you when you return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of 
          visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was 
          opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source 
          of a new page visit. Tap Academy uses the following types of cookies:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <li><b>Preferences:</b> cookies that remember data about your browser and preferred settings that affect the appearance and behavior of the Services (like your preferred language).</li>
            <li><b>Security:</b> cookies used to enable you to log in and access the Services; protect against fraudulent logins; and help detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account.</li>
            <li><b>Functional:</b> cookies that store functional settings (like the volume level you set for video playback).</li>
            <li><b>Session State:</b> cookies that track your interactions with the Services to help us improve the Services and your browsing experience, remember your login details, and enable processing of your course purchases. These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable.</li>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different or less functional.

We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on different devices and provide information that may be of interest to you.

<h2>3.3 Online Advertising</h2>
<font size="4px">
    We use third-party advertising services like Facebook, Google’s ad services, and other ad networks and ad servers to deliver advertising about our Services on other websites and applications you use. The ads may be based on things we know about you, like your Usage Data and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services and may be tailored to your interests.

<h2>5. Who We Share Your Data With</h2>
<font size="4px">
    We share certain data about you with instructors, program managers, other students, companies performing services for us, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent. We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy: <br><br>
    <li><b>With Your Learning Consultants, Admissions and Tap Academy Team:</b> We share data that we have about you with your Learning Consultant and our Admission Team, so they can suggest the right program or course for you. This data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, email id, phone number, your work experience and other work-related information, your activities on our website and learning management system.</li>
    <li><b>With Your Instructors, Evaluators, Moderators and Mentors:</b> We share data that we have about you with instructors or teaching assistants for courses you enroll in or request information about, so they can improve their courses for you and other students. This data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, email id, phone number, your work experience, and other work-related information, your activities on our website and learning management system.</li>
    <li><b>With Other Students and Instructors:</b> Depending on your settings, your shared content, and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also be publicly viewable by other users depending on your settings.</li>
    <li><b>With Students, public and other mentors:</b> If you’re a mentor or Instructor, we share data that we have about you with students, program managers and employees of Tap Academy, so they can reach out to you to clarify questions or provide services to you. This data may include things like your name, email id, phone number, professional and education details, your activities on our website and learning management system.</li>
    <li><b>With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:</b> We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, reward processing, data analysis, marketing, and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and hosting services, and customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service.</li>
    <li><b>With Business Partners:</b> We have agreements with other websites and platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to Tap Academy.</li>
    <li><b>With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:</b> As part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics and data enrichment services like Clearbit or Pipl, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1), or de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.</li>
    <li><b>To Power Social Media Features:</b> The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Share) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.</li>
    <li><b>To Administer Promotions and Surveys:</b> We may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.</li>
    <li><b>For Advertising:</b> If we decide to offer advertising in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.</li>
    <li><b>For Security and Legal Compliance:</b> We may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:</li>
    <blockquote>
        <li>Permitted or required by law;</li>
        <li>Requested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding;</li>
        <li>Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request;</li>
        <li>Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements;</li>
        <li>Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or</li>
        <li>Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Tap Academy, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services.</li>
        <li>We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy.</li>

    <li><b>After Aggregation/De-identification:</b> we can disclose or use aggregate or de-identified data for any purpose.</li>
    <li><b>With Your Permission:</b> with your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</li>
</font>
<h2>6. Security</h2>
<font size="4px">We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account. Tap Academy takes appropriate security measures such as using HTTPS to transfer your data to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Tap Academy, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately.</font>
<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<font size="4px"> You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain analytics providers. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data such to to restrict our processing of your data, to erase all data we have stored about you, and the right to ask for the data to be provided to you/ported to any other service in a commonly used machine readable format. Parents who believe we’ve unintentionally collected personal data about their underage child should contact us for help deleting that information.

We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Tap Academy. We use persistent cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period, like when you request that we keep you signed in. Why does Tap Academy use cookies and similar technologies? We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways.
